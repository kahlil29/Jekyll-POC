Trip variants help you create different pricing on the trip level while keeping the basic information the same. You can create trip variants to keep on parameter different and others the same across two trips. So there can be food walks which are veg or non-veg, the same trip can have guides in different languages as different variants. You can also use the variant option to differentiate between rates of weekdays and weekends.

You get the option to create variants in the pricing section
